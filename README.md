# Globetrotter
Senior Project

This is my capstone project using Android Studio. It is essentially a game where the user is encouraged to travel.

The user starts at a point of origin, when they travel to a different location, they can enter the new location's longitude and latitude and the app returns a score.
As the user travels to more location, their score accumulates. 

The app can also help provide more information on the location entered by the user. The app uses Google's Places and Maps APIs.
